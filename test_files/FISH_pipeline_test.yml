##### Parameters Calculate TS
#  -MaskTS : "nucleus " or "cell". Mask used for defining the TS (brightest spot)
#  -AreaNorm : "cyto", "nucleus" or "cell". Area used for the normalizing spots. "cyto" means in cell but not in nucleus, "nucleus" mean nucleus and "cell" means entire cell including nucleus.
#  -ExclEmpty : 0 or 1. excludes cells that are completely empty, no RNAs in either nucleus or cytoplasm. Uses channel that is analyzed to determine if cell is empty. If you want to use another channel, set ExlcEmpty 0 and set parameter useControlForEmptyCells to 1.
#  -useControlForEmptyCells : 0 or 1 . Uses control hybridization (can be other channel) to determine whether cell is empty (no RNA in cell or nucleus). Removes these cells from analysis in all colors. Set control channel with parameter controlColor. Can only be used if ExclEmpty: 0
#  -controlColor: 0 or 1. 0 = Cy3, 1 = Cy5. Set which probe set is control. Is used if useControlForEmptyCells is 1.
#  -useFit: 0 or 1 # if 1: normalize TS distribution by intensity from fit of the cytoplasmic intensity distribution with a gaussian model. If 0: normalize TS distribution by median intensity cytoplasmic spots
#  -useNormValue : 0 or 1. Set to 1 if you would like to make additional histograms in which the normalization constant (intensity of single RNA) is user-defined
#  -NormValueCy3 : Set user-defined normValue for Cy3 (if useNormValue is 1). Recommended that you obtain value based on 'cyto-distribution' histogram for Cy3 channel. Example: 13384.
#  -NormValueCy5 : Set user-defined normValue for Cy5 (if useNormValue is 1). Recommended that you obtain value based on 'cyto-distribution' histogram for Cy5 channel. Example: 4421.
#  -includeMultTS : 0, 1 or 2. 0 for one TS per nucleus, 1 for multiple TS per nucleus using threshold (specify thresholdTS), 2 for multiple TS per nucleus by fixed amount (specify nrTS2Include).
#  -thresholdTS : threshold used to determine if nuclear spot is TS (if includeMultTS is 1). The threshold indicates how many nascent RNAs need to present to qualify as TS (it is is multiplied by the normalization factor of the cytoplasmic spot intensity). Note, the results do not contain the cells without TS. Example: 1.5
#  -nrTS2Include :number of TS to include in the analysis (if includeMultTS is 2). It will select the brightest spots as TS. Note, if less TS are found in a nucleus, the script will add a zero (so each cell will have same nr of TS). Example: 2
